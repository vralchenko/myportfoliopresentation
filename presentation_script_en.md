# Extended Presentation Script (15-20 min)

This script is designed for a detailed presentation, where each project takes about 4-5 minutes, plus introduction and conclusions.

## 🇺🇸 ENGLISH (STRATEGIC OVERVIEW)

### 1. Introduction (2 min)
*   **Context:** Viktor Ralchenko, Senior Software Engineer. 20+ years of building everything from low-level systems to complex cloud architectures.
*   **Vision:** My current focus is bridging the gap between robust software engineering and the chaotic, high-potential world of Generative AI.

### 2. AI Career Strategist (5-6 min)
*   **The Problem:** The hiring process is broken. Resume "keyword stuffing" is overshadowing genuine talent. Candidates are ghosted or given generic rejections.
*   **The Solution:** A platform built for deep alignment, not just formatting.
*   **Technical Rationale:**
    *   **Next.js 16:** Chosen for its industry-leading performance and Turbopack support. In career tech, every millisecond counts toward user retention.
    *   **Groq (Llama 3.1):** We solve the "long AI silence" problem. Standard LLM APIs take 5-10 seconds to respond; Groq provides near-instant inference, enabling a conversational flow.
    *   **SSE Streaming:** We deliver data as it's generated. This creates a transparent UX where the user sees the AI’s thought process behind the metrics.
    *   **Hybrid Persona Logic:** We aim to bypass "AI detectors" by drafting content that emphasizes unique human career highlights, which generic GPT wrappers fail to do.

### 3. Foreteller (4-5 min)
*   **The Problem:** Generic horoscopes provide zero value for personal growth. People want a roadmap, not magic tricks.
*   **The Solution:** An AI-powered personality blueprint integrating Pythagoras square and cosmic archetypes.
*   **Tech Stack:** React 18 with a premium Glassmorphism UI. It conveys a "modern high-tech tool" vibe rather than a mystical one.
*   **Value Proposition:** Turning abstract data into actionable career and personal growth advice.

### 4. BizLingo (4-5 min)
*   **The Problem:** Language apps are too rigid. In business, there are many ways to express an idea. Fixed-match systems fail advanced learners.
*   **The Solution:** An app that validates based on **semantics**.
*   **Tech Stack:** **Flutter** for cross-platform delivery (Web/Android/iOS). **Groq API** for zero-latency semantic checks.
*   **The Innovation:** Instead of a "Wrong" mark, the AI says: *"You chose a great synonym. Here is the subtle difference in business context."* This fosters confidence, not frustration.

### 5. Conclusion (2-3 min)
*   I combine two decades of "hardcore" engineering with cutting-edge AI. I’m looking for a team where this balance of stability and innovation can thrive.
*   Ready for your questions.
